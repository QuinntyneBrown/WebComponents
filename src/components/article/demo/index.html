It\u0027ll kick off in August and is built around West\u0027s ever-evolving album The Life of Pablo, which Yeezy released in February. And just now the album\u0027s made another big leap forward with the addition of a track named \u0022Saint Pablo.\u0022 \u000A\u000ASee, a few months ago, Kanye showed up to 1 Oak, a club in Los Angeles, and played \u0022Saint Pablo.\u0022 \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ANo one heard the song again after that show—until now. \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AJust before midnight last night (June 14), Kanye added the song to The Life of Pablo. It features Sampha and samples the drums from \u0022Where I\u0027m From\u0022 by Jay Z, but more importantly, the track is brutally honest and fairly scattershot in the signature Kanye West–ian way. Yeezy obliquely mentions his self-declared 53-million-dollar debt (\u0022Got friends asking me for money knowing I\u0027m in debt\u0022), affirms his influence on pop culture (\u0022I know that I\u0027m the most influential\u0022), and features some dicey lines about Jews (\u0022The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime,\u0022 he raps, apparently quoting the controversial minister Farrakhan).\u000A\u000AKanye\u0027s already promised another album this summer (supposedly dubbed Turbo Grafx 16), but with a tour launching in August, that seems unlikely. We\u0027re wondering if Kanye will ever release another album or if he\u0027ll just keep updating TLOP. Truth be told, we don\u0027t really care how he delivers new music, just so long as he keeps it coming."
